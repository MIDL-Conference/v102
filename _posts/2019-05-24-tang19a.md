title: 'XLSor: A Robust and Accurate Lung Segmentor on Chest X-Rays Using Criss-Cross
  Attention and Customized Radiorealistic Abnormalities Generation'
abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for lung segmentation in chest X-rays.
  It consists of two key contributions, a criss-cross attention based segmentation
  network and radiorealistic chest X-ray image synthesis (\textit{i}.\textit{e}.  a
  synthesized radiograph that appears anatomically realistic) for data augmentation.
  The criss-cross attention modules capture rich global contextual information in
  both horizontal and vertical directions for all the pixels thus facilitating accurate
  lung segmentation.  To reduce the manual annotation burden and to train a robust
  lung segmentor that can be adapted to pathological lungs with hazy lung boundaries,
  an image-to-image translation module is employed to synthesize radiorealistic abnormal
  CXRs from the source of normal ones for data augmentation.  The lung masks of synthetic
  abnormal CXRs are propagated from the segmentation results of their normal counterparts,
  and then serve as pseudo masks for robust segmentor training. In addition, we annotate
  100 CXRs with lung masks on a more challenging NIH Chest X-ray dataset containing
  both posterioranterior and anteroposterior views for evaluation. Extensive experiments
  validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed framework. The code and
  data can be found from \url{https://github.com/rsummers11/CADLab/tree/master/Lung_Segmentation_XLSor}.

title: 'Group-Attention Single-Shot Detector (GA-SSD): Finding Pulmonary Nodules in
  Large-Scale CT Images'
abstract: Early diagnosis of pulmonary nodules (PNs) can improve the survival rate
  of patients and yet is a challenging task for radiologists due to the image noise
  and artifacts in computed tomography (CT) images. In this paper, we propose a novel
  and effective abnormality detector implementing the attention mechanism and group
  convolution on 3D single-shot detector (SSD) called group-attention SSD (GA-SSD).
  We find that group convolution is effective in extracting rich context information
  between continuous slices, and attention network can learn the target features automatically.
  We collected a large-scale dataset that contained 4146 CT scans with annotations
  of varying types and sizes of PNs (even PNs smaller than 3mm). To the best of our
  knowledge, this dataset is the largest cohort with relatively complete annotations
  for PNs detection. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed group-attention
  SSD outperforms the conventional SSD framework as well as the state-of-the-art 3DCNN,
  especially on some challenging lesion types.

title: Capturing Single-Cell Phenotypic Variation via Unsupervised Representation
  Learning
abstract: We propose a novel variational autoencoder (VAE) framework for learning
  representations of cell images for the domain of image-based profiling, important
  for new therapeutic discovery. Previously, generative adversarial network-based
  (GAN) approaches were proposed to enable biologists to visualize structural variations
  in cells that drive differences in populations. However, while the images were realistic,
  they did not provide direct reconstructions from representations, and their performance
  in downstream analysis was poor.  We address these limitations in our approach by
  adding an adversarial-driven similarity constraint applied to the standard VAE framework,
  and a progressive training procedure that allows higher quality reconstructions
  than standard VAEâ€™s. The proposed models improve classification accuracy by 22%
  (to 90%) compared to the best reported GAN model, making it competitive with other
  models that have higher quality representations, but lack the ability to synthesize
  images. This provides researchers a new tool to match cellular phenotypes effectively,
  and also to gain better insight into cellular structure variations that are driving
  differences between populations of cells.

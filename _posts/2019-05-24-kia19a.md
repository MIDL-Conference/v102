title: Neural Processes Mixed-Effect Models for Deep Normative Modeling of Clinical
  Neuroimaging Data
abstract: Normative modeling has recently been introduced as a promising approach
  for modeling variation of neuroimaging measures across individuals in order to derive
  biomarkers of psychiatric disorders. Current implementations rely on Gaussian process
  regression, which provides coherent estimates of uncertainty needed for the method
  but also suffers from drawbacks including poor scaling to large datasets and a reliance
  on fixed parametric kernels. In this paper, we propose a deep normative modeling
  framework based on neural processes (NPs) to solve these problems. To achieve this,
  we define a stochastic process formulation for mixed-effect models and show how
  NPs can be adopted for spatially structured mixed-effect modeling of neuroimaging
  data. This enables us to learn optimal feature representations and covariance structure
  for the random-effect and noise via global latent variables. In this scheme, predictive
  uncertainty can be approximated by sampling from the distribution of these global
  latent variables. On a publicly available clinical fMRI dataset, we compare the
  novelty detection performance of multivariate normative models estimated by the
  proposed NP approach to a baseline multi-task Gaussian process regression approach
  and show substantial improvements for certain diagnostic problems.

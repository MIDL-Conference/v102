title: Dynamic MRI Reconstruction with Motion-Guided Network
abstract: 'Temporal correlation in dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), such
  as cardiac MRI, is informative and important to understand motion mechanisms of
  body regions. Modeling such information into the MRI reconstruction process produces
  temporally coherent image sequence and reduces imaging artifacts and blurring.  However,
  existing deep learning based approaches neglect motion information during the reconstruction
  procedure, while traditional motion-guided methods are hindered by heuristic parameter
  tuning and long inference time. We propose a novel dynamic MRI reconstruction approach
  called MODRN that unitizes deep neural networks with motion information to improve
  reconstruction quality. The central idea is to decompose the motion-guided optimization
  problem of dynamic MRI reconstruction into three components: dynamic reconstruction,
  motion estimation and motion compensation. Extensive experiments have demonstrated
  the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.'

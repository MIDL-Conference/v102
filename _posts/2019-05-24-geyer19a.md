title: Transfer Learning by Adaptive Merging of Multiple Models
abstract: Transfer learning has been an important ingredient of state-of-the-art deep
  learning models. In particular, it has significant impact when little data is available
  for the target task, such as in many medical imaging applications. Typically, transfer
  learning means pre-training the target model on a related task which has sufficient
  data available. However, often pre-trained models from several related tasks are
  available, and it would be desirable to transfer their combined knowledge by automatic
  weighting and merging. For this reason, we propose T-IMM (Transfer Incremental Mode
  Matching), a method to leverage several pre-trained models, which extends the concept
  of Incremental Mode Matching from lifelong learning to the transfer learning setting.
  Our method introduces layer wise mixing ratios, which are learned automatically
  and fuse multiple pre-trained models before fine-tuning on the new task. We demonstrate
  the efficacy of our method by the example of brain tumor segmentation in MRI (BRATS
  2018 Challange). We show that fusing weights according to our framework, merging
  two models trained on general brain parcellation can greatly enhance the final model
  performance for small training sets when compared to standard transfer methods or
  state-of the art initialization. We further demonstrate that the benefit remains
  even when training on the entire Brats 2018 data set (255 patients).

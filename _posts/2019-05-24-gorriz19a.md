title: Assessing Knee OA Severity with CNN attention-based end-to-end architectures
abstract: 'This work proposes a novel end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN)
  architecture to automatically quantify the severity of knee osteoarthritis (OA)
  using X-Ray images, which incorporates trainable attention modules acting as unsupervised
  fine-grained detectors of the region of interest (ROI). The proposed attention modules
  can be applied at different levels and scales across any CNN pipeline helping the
  network to learn relevant attention patterns over the most informative parts of
  the image at different resolutions. We test the proposed attention mechanism on
  existing state-of-the-art CNN architectures as our base models, achieving promising
  results on the benchmark knee OA datasets from the osteoarthritis initiative (OAI)
  and multicenter osteoarthritis study (MOST). All code from our experiments will
  be publicly available on the github repository: \url{https://github.com/marc-gorriz/KneeOA-CNNAttention}'

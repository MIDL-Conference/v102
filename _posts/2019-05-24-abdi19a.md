title: 'AnatomyGen: Deep Anatomy Generation From Dense Representation With Applications
  in Mandible Synthesis'
abstract: This work is an effort in human anatomy synthesis using deep models. Here,
  we introduce a deterministic deep convolutional architecture to generate human anatomies
  represented as 3D binarized occupancy maps (voxel-grids).  The shape generation
  process is constrained by the 3D coordinates of a small set of landmarks selected
  on the surface of the anatomy. The proposed learning framework is empirically tested
  on the mandible bone where it was able to reconstruct the anatomies from landmark
  coordinates with the average landmark-to-surface error of 1.42Â mm. Moreover, the
  model was able to linearly interpolate in the $\mathbb{Z}$-space and smoothly morph
  a given 3D anatomy to another.  The proposed approach can potentially be used in
  semi-automated segmentation with manual landmark selection as well as biomechanical
  modeling. Our main contribution is to demonstrate that deep convolutional architectures
  can generate high fidelity complex human  anatomies from abstract representations.

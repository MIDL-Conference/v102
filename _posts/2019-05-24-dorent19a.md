title: Learning joint lesion and tissue segmentation from task-specific hetero-modal
  datasets
abstract: Brain tissue segmentation from multimodal MRI is a key building block of
  many neuroscience analysis pipelines. It could also play an important role in many
  clinical imaging scenarios. Established tissue segmentation approaches have however
  not been developed to cope with large anatomical changes resulting from pathology.
  The effect of the presence of brain lesions, for example, on their performance is
  thus currently uncontrolled and practically unpredictable. Contrastingly, with the
  advent of deep neural networks (DNNs), segmentation of brain lesions has matured
  significantly and is achieving performance levels making it of interest for clinical
  use. However, few existing approaches allow for jointly segmenting normal tissue
  and brain lesions. Developing a DNN for such joint task is currently hampered by
  the fact that annotated datasets typically address only one specific task and rely
  on a task-specific hetero-modal imaging protocol. In this work, we propose a novel
  approach to build a joint tissue and lesion segmentation model from task-specific
  hetero-modal and partially annotated datasets. Starting from a variational formulation
  of the joint problem, we show how the expected risk can be decomposed and optimised
  empirically. We exploit an upper-bound of the risk to deal with missing imaging
  modalities. For each task, our approach reaches comparable performance than task-specific
  and fully-supervised models.

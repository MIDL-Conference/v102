title: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Subpixel Neural Tracking
abstract: Automatically tracing elongated structures, such as axons and blood vessels,
  is a challenging problem in the field of biomedical imaging, but one with many downstream
  applications. Real, labelled data is sparse, and existing algorithms either lack
  robustness to different datasets, or otherwise require significant manual tuning.
  Here, we instead learn a tracking algorithm in a synthetic environment, and apply
  it to tracing axons. To do so, we formulate tracking as a reinforcement learning
  problem, and apply deep reinforcement learning techniques with a continuous action
  space to learn how to track at the subpixel level. We train our model on simple
  synthetic data and test it on mouse cortical two-photon microscopy images. Despite
  the domain gap, our model approaches the performance of a heavily engineered tracker
  from a standard analysis suite for neuronal microscopy. We show that fine-tuning
  on real data improves performance, allowing better transfer when real labelled data
  is available. Finally, we demonstrate that our model’s uncertainty measure—a feature
  lacking in hand-engineered trackers—corresponds with how well it tracks the structure.

title: Boundary loss for highly unbalanced segmentation
abstract: 'Widely used loss functions for convolutional neural network (CNN) segmentation,
  e.g., Dice or cross-entropy, are based on integrals (summations) over the segmentation
  regions. Unfortunately, for  highly unbalanced segmentations, such regional losses
  have values that differ considerably – typically of several orders of magnitude
  – across segmentation classes, which may affect training performance and stability.
  We propose a boundary loss, which takes the form of a distance metric on the space
  of contours (or shapes), not regions. This can mitigate the difficulties of regional
  losses in the context of highly unbalanced segmentation problems because it uses
  integrals over the boundary (interface) between regions instead of unbalanced integrals
  over regions. Furthermore, a boundary loss provides information that is complimentary
  to regional losses. Unfortunately, it is not straightforward to represent the boundary
  points corresponding to the regional softmax outputs of a CNN. Our boundary loss
  is inspired by discrete (graph-based) optimization techniques for computing gradient
  flows of curve evolution. Following an integral approach for computing boundary
  variations, we express a non-symmetric $L_2$ distance on the space of shapes as
  a regional integral, which avoids completely local differential computations involving
  contour points. This yields a boundary loss expressed with the regional softmax
  probability outputs of the network, which can be easily combined with standard regional
  losses and implemented with any existing deep network architecture for N-D segmentation.  We
  report comprehensive evaluations on two benchmark datasets corresponding to difficult,
  highly unbalanced problems: the ischemic stroke lesion (ISLES) and white matter
  hyperintensities (WMH). Used in conjunction with the region-based generalized Dice
  loss (GDL), our boundary loss improves performance significantly compared to GDL
  alone, reaching up to 8% improvement in Dice score and 10%  improvement in Hausdorff
  score. It also yielded a more stable learning process. Our code is publicly available.'

title: 3D multirater RCNN for multimodal multiclass detection and characterisation
  of extremely small objects
abstract: Extremely small objects (ESO) have become observable on clinical routine
  magnetic resonance imaging acquisitions, thanks to a reduction in acquisition time
  at higher resolution. Despite their small size (usually <10 voxels per object for
  an image of more than $10^6$ voxels), these markers reflect tissue damage and need
  to be accounted for to investigate the complete phenotype of complex pathological
  pathways. In addition to their very small size, variability in shape and appearance
  leads to high labelling variability across human raters, resulting in a very noisy
  gold standard.  Such objects are notably present in the context of cerebral small
  vessel disease where enlarged perivascular spaces and lacunes, commonly observed
  in the ageing population, are thought to be associated with acceleration of cognitive
  decline and risk of dementia onset. In this work, we redesign the RCNN model to
  scale to 3D data, and to jointly detect and characterise these important markers
  of age-related neurovascular changes. We also propose training strategies enforcing
  the detection of extremely small objects, ensuring a tractable and stable training
  process.

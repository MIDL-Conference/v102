title: Training Deep Networks on Domain Randomized Synthetic X-ray Data for Cardiac
  Interventions
abstract: 'One of the most significant challenges of using machine learning to create
  practical clinical applications in medical imaging is the limited availability of
  training data and accurate annotations. This problem is acute in novel multi-modal
  image registration applications where complete datasets may not be collected in
  standard clinical practice, data may be collected at different times and deformation
  makes perfect annotations impossible. Training machine learning systems on fully
  synthetic data is becoming increasingly common in the research community. However,
  transferring to real world applications without compromising performance is highly
  challenging. Transfer learning methods adapt the training data, learned features,
  or the trained models to provide higher performance on the target domain. These
  methods are designed with the  available samples, but if the samples used are not
  representative of the target domain, the method will overfit to the samples and
  will not generalize. This problem is exacerbated in medical imaging, where data
  of the target domain is extremely scarse. This paper proposes to use Domain Randomization
  (DR) to bridge the reality gap between the training and target domains, requiring
  no samples of the target domain. DR adds unrealistic perturbations to the training
  data, such that the target domain becomes just another variation. The effects of
  DR are demonstrated on a challenging task: 3D/2D cardiac model-to-X-ray registration,
  trained fully on synthetic data generated from 1711 clinical CT volumes. A thorough
  qualitative and quantitative evaluation of transfer to clinical data is performed.
  Results show that without DR training parameters have little influence on performance
  on the training domain of digitally reconstructed radiographs, but can cause substantial
  variation on the target domain (X-rays). DR results in a significantly more consistent
  transfer to the target domain.'

title: 'Exclusive Independent Probability Estimation using Deep 3D Fully Convolutional
  DenseNets: Application to IsoIntense Infant Brain MRI Segmentation'
abstract: The most recent fast and accurate image segmentation methods are built upon
  fully convolutional deep neural networks. In particular, densely connected convolutional
  neural networks (DenseNets) have shown excellent performance in detection and segmentation
  tasks. In this paper, we propose new deep learning strategies for DenseNets to improve
  segmenting images with subtle differences in intensity values and features. In particular,
  we aim to segment brain tissue on infant brain MRI at about 6 months of age where
  white matter and gray matter of the developing brain show similar T1 and T2 relaxation
  times, thus appear to have similar intensity values on both T1- and T2-weighted
  MRI scans. Brain tissue segmentation at this age is, therefore, very challenging.  To
  this end, we propose an exclusive multi-label training strategy to segment the mutually
  exclusive brain tissues with similarity loss functions that automatically balance
  the training based on class prevalence. Using our proposed training strategy based
  on similarity loss functions and patch prediction fusion we decrease the number
  of parameters in the network, reduce the number of training classes, focusing the
  attention on less number of tasks, while mitigating the effects of data imbalance
  between labels and inaccuracies near patch borders. By taking advantage of these
  strategies we were able to perform fast image segmentation (less than 90 seconds
  per 3D volume) using a network with less parameters than many state-of-the-art networks
  (1.4 million parameters), overcoming issues such as 3D vs 2D training and large
  vs small patch size selection, while achieving the top performance in segmenting
  brain tissue among all methods tested in first and second round submissions of the
  isointense infant brain MRI segmentation (iSeg) challenge according to the official
  challenge test results. Our strategy improved the training process through balanced
  training and reduced complexity, and provided a trained model that works for any
  size input image and is faster and more accurate than many state-of-the-art methods.

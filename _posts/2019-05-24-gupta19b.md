title: Generative Image Translation for Data Augmentation of Bone Lesion Pathology
abstract: Insufficient training data and severe class imbalance are often limiting
  factors when developing machine learning models for the classification of rare diseases.
  In this work, we address the problem of classifying bone lesions from X-ray images
  by increasing the small number of positive samples in the training set. We propose
  a generative data augmentation approach based on a cycle-consistent generative adversarial
  network that synthesizes bone lesions on images without pathology. We pose the generative
  task as an image-patch translation problem that we optimize specifically for distinct
  bones (humerus, tibia, femur). In experimental results, we confirm that the described
  method mitigates the class imbalance problem in the binary classification task of
  bone lesion detection. We show that the augmented training sets enable the training
  of superior classifiers achieving better performance on a held-out test set. Additionally,
  we demonstrate the feasibility of transfer learning and apply a generative model
  that was trained on one body part to another.

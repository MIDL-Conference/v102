title: Image Synthesis with a Convolutional Capsule Generative Adversarial Network
abstract: Machine learning for biomedical imaging often suffers from a lack of labelled
  training data. One solution is to use generative models to synthesise more data.
  To this end, we introduce CapsPix2Pix, which combines convolutional capsules with
  the \texttt{pix2pix} framework, to synthesise images conditioned on class segmentation
  labels. We apply our approach to a new biomedical dataset of cortical axons imaged
  by two-photon microscopy, as a method of data augmentation for small datasets. We
  evaluate performance both qualitatively and quantitatively. Quantitative evaluation
  is performed by using image data generated by either CapsPix2Pix or \texttt{pix2pix}
  to train a U-net on a segmentation task, then testing on real microscopy data. Our
  method quantitatively performs as well as \texttt{pix2pix}, with an order of magnitude
  fewer parameters. Additionally, CapsPix2Pix is far more capable at synthesising
  images of different appearance, but the same underlying geometry. Finally, qualitative
  analysis of the features learned by CapsPix2Pix suggests that individual capsules
  capture diverse and often semantically meaningful groups of features, covering structures
  such as synapses, axons and noise.

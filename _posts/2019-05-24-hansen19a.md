title: Sparse Structured Prediction for Semantic Edge Detection in Medical Images
abstract: 'In medical image analysis most state-of-the-art methods rely on deep neural
  networks with learned convolutional filters. For pixel-level tasks, e.g. multi-class
  segmentation, approaches build upon UNet-like encoder-decoder architectures show
  impressive results. However, at the same time, grid-based models often process images
  unnecessarily dense introducing large time and memory requirements. Therefore it
  is still a challenging problem to deploy recent methods in the clinical setting.
  Evaluating images on only a limited number of locations has the potential to overcome
  those limitations and may also enable the acquisition of medical images using adaptive
  sparse sampling, which could substantially reduce scan times and radiation doses.
  In this work we investigate the problem of semantic edge detection in CT and X-ray
  images from sparse sampling locations. We propose a deep learning architecture that
  comprises of two parts: 1) a lightweight fully convolutional CNN to extract informative
  sampling points and 2) our novel sparse structured prediction network (SSPNet).
  The SSPNet processes image patches on a graph generated from the sampled locations
  and outputs semantic edge activations for each patch which are accumulated in an
  array via a weighted voting scheme to recover a dense prediction. We conduct several
  ablation experiments for our network on a dataset consisting of 10 abdominal CT
  slices from VISCERAL and evaluate its performance against strong baseline UNets
  on the JSRT database of chest X-rays.'

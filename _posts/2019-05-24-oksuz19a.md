title: High-quality segmentation of low quality cardiac MR images using k-space artefact
  correction
abstract: Deep learning methods have shown great success in segmenting the anatomical
  and pathological structures in medical images. This success is closely bounded with
  the quality of the  images in the dataset that are being segmented. A commonly overlooked
  issue in the medical image analysis community is the vast amount of clinical images
  that have severe image artefacts. In this paper, we discuss the implications of
  image artefacts on cardiac MR segmentation and compare a variety of approaches for
  motion artefact correction with our proposed method Automap-GAN. Our method is based
  on the recently developed Automap reconstruction method, which directly reconstructs
  high quality MR images from k-space using deep learning. We propose to use a loss
  function that combines mean square error with structural similarity index to robustly
  segment poor-quality images. We train the reconstruction network to automatically
  correct for motion-related artefacts using synthetically corrupted CMR k-space data
  and uncorrected reconstructed images. In the experiments, we apply the proposed
  method to correct for motion artefacts on a large dataset of 1,400 subjects to improve
  image quality. The improvement of image quality is quantitatively assessed using
  segmentation accuracy as a metric. The segmentation is improved from 0.63 to 0.72
  dice overlap after artefact correction. We quantitatively compare our method with
  a variety of techniques for recovering image quality to showcase the influence on
  segmentation. In addition, we qualitatively evaluate the proposed technique using
  k-space data containing real motion artefacts.

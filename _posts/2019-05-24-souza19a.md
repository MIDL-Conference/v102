title: A Hybrid, Dual Domain, Cascade of Convolutional Neural Networks for Magnetic
  Resonance Image Reconstruction
abstract: Deep-learning-based magnetic resonance (MR) imaging reconstruction techniques
  have the potential to accelerate MR image acquisition by reconstructing in real-time
  clinical quality images from k-spaces sampled at rates lower than specified by the
  Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, which is known as compressed sensing. In the past
  few years, several deep learning network architectures have been proposed for MR
  compressed sensing reconstruction. After examining the successful elements in these
  network architectures, we propose a hybrid frequency-/image-domain cascade of convolutional
  neural networks intercalated with data consistency layers that is trained end-to-end
  for compressed sensing reconstruction of MR images. We compare our method with five
  recently published deep learning-based methods using MR raw data. Our results indicate
  that our architecture improvements were statistically significant (Wilcoxon signed-rank
  test, $p<0.05$). Visual assessment of the images reconstructed confirm that our
  method outputs images similar to the fully sampled reconstruction reference.

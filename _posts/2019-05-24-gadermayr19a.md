title: Unsupervisedly Training GANs for Segmenting Digital Pathology with Automatically
  Generated Annotations
abstract: Recently, generative adversarial networks exhibited excellent performances
  in semi-supervised image analysis scenarios. In this paper, we go even further by
  proposing a fully unsupervised approach for segmentation applications with prior
  knowledge of the objectsâ€™ shapes. We propose and investigate different strategies
  to generate simulated label data and perform image-to-image translation between
  the image and the label domain using an adversarial model. For experimental evaluation,
  we consider the segmentation of the glomeruli, an application scenario from renal
  pathology. Experiments provide proof of concept and also confirm that the strategy
  for creating the simulated label data is of particular relevance considering the
  stability of GAN trainings.

title: 'CARE: Class Attention to Regions of Lesion for Classification on Imbalanced
  Data'
abstract: To date, it is still an open and challenging problem for intelligent diagnosis
  systems to effectively learn from imbalanced data, especially with large samples
  of common diseases and much smaller samples of rare ones. Inspired by the process
  of human learning, this paper proposes a novel and effective way to embed attention
  into the machine learning process, particularly for learning characteristics of
  rare diseases. This approach does not change architectures of the original CNN classifiers
  and therefore can directly plug and play for any existing CNN architecture. Comprehensive
  experiments on a skin lesion dataset and a pneumonia chest X-ray dataset showed
  that paying attention to lesion regions of rare diseases during learning not only
  improved the classification performance on rare diseases, but also on the mean class
  accuracy.

title: Weakly Supervised Deep Nuclei Segmentation using Points Annotation in Histopathology
  Images
abstract: Nuclei segmentation is a fundamental task in histopathological image analysis.
  Typically, such segmentation tasks require significant effort to manually generate
  pixel-wise annotations for fully supervised training. To alleviate the manual effort,
  in this paper we propose a novel approach using points only annotation. Two types
  of coarse labels with complementary information are derived from the points annotation,
  and are then utilized to train a deep neural network. The fully-connected conditional
  random field loss is utilized to further refine the model without introducing extra
  computational complexity during inference. Experimental results on two nuclei segmentation
  datasets reveal that the proposed method is able to achieve competitive performance
  compared to the fully supervised counterpart and the state-of-the-art methods while
  requiring significantly less annotation effort. Our code is publicly available.

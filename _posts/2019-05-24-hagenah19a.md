title: 'Cluster Analysis in Latent Space: Identifying Personalized Aortic Valve Prosthesis
  Shapes using Deep Representations'
abstract: Due to the high inter-patient variability of anatomies, the field of personalized
  prosthetics gained attention during the last years. One potential application is
  the aortic valve. Even though its shape is highly patient-specific, state-of-the-art
  aortic valve prosthesis are not capable of reproducing this individual geometry.
  An appraoch to reach an economically reasonable personalization would be the identification
  of typical valve shapes using clustering, such that each patient could be treated
  with the prosthesis of the type that matches his individual geometry best. However,
  a cluster analysis directly in image space is not sufficient due to the curse of
  dimensionality and the high sensitivity to small translations or rotations. In this
  work, we propose representation learning to perform the cluster analysis in the
  latent space, while the evaluation of the identified prosthesis shapes is performed
  in image space using generative modeling. To this end, we set up a data set of 58
  porcine aortic valves and provide a proof-of-concept of our method using convolutional
  autoencoders. Furthermore, we evaluated the learned representation regarding its
  reconstruction accuracy, compactness and smoothness. To the best of our knowledge,
  this work presents the first approach to derive prosthesis shapes data-drivenly
  using clustering in latent space.

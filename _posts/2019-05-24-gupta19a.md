title: Iterative learning to make the most of unlabeled and quickly obtained labeled
  data in histology
abstract: Due to the increasing availability of digital whole slide scanners, the
  importance of image analysis in the field of digital pathology increased significantly.
  A major challenge and an equally big opportunity for analyses in this field is given
  by the wide range of tasks and different histological stains. Although sufficient
  image data is often available for training, the requirement for corresponding expert
  annotations inhibits clinical deployment.  Thus, there is an urgent need for methods
  which can be effectively trained with or adapted to a small amount of labeled training
  data.  Here, we propose a method to find an optimum trade-off between (low) annotation
  effort and (high) segmentation accuracy. For this purpose, we propose an approach
  based on a weakly supervised and an unsupervised learning stage relying on few roughly
  labeled samples and many unlabeled samples.  Although the idea of weakly annotated
  data is not new, we firstly investigate the applicability to digital pathology in
  a state-of-the-art machine learning setting.

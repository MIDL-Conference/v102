title: Digitally Stained Confocal Microscopy through Deep Learning
abstract: Specialists have used confocal microscopy in the ex-vivo modality to identify
  Basal Cell Carcinoma tumors with an overall sensitivity of 96.6% and specificity
  of 89.2% {{Chung et al.}} ({2004}). However, this technology hasn’t established
  yet in the standard clinical practice because most pathologists lack the knowledge
  to interpret its output. In this paper we propose a combination of deep learning
  and computer vision techniques to digitally stain confocal microscopy images into
  H&E-like slides, enabling pathologists to interpret these images without specific
  training. We use a fully convolutional neural network with a multiplicative residual
  connection to denoise the confocal microscopy images, and then stain them using
  a Cycle Consistency Generative Adversarial Network.

title: Fusing Unsupervised and Supervised Deep Learning for White Matter Lesion Segmentation
abstract: Unsupervised Deep Learning for Medical Image Analysis is increasingly gaining
  attention, since it relieves from the need for annotating training data. Recently,
  deep generative models and representation learning have lead to new, exciting ways
  for unsupervised detection and delineation of biomarkers in medical images, such
  as lesions in brain MR. Yet, Supervised Deep Learning methods usually still perform
  better in these tasks, due to an optimization for explicit objectives. We aim to
  combine the advantages of both worlds into a novel framework for learning from both
  labeled & unlabeled data, and validate our method on the challenging task of White
  Matter lesion segmentation in brain MR images. The proposed framework relies on
  modeling normality with deep representation learning for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection,
  which in turn provides optimization targets for training a supervised segmentation
  model from unlabeled data. In our experiments we successfully use the method in
  a Semi-supervised setting for tackling domain shift, a well known problem in MR
  image analysis, showing dramatically improved generalization. Additionally, our
  experiments reveal that in a completely Unsupervised setting, the proposed pipeline
  even outperforms the Deep Learning driven anomaly detection that provides the optimization
  targets.

title: 'DavinciGAN: Unpaired Surgical Instrument Translation for Data Augmentation'
abstract: Recognizing surgical instruments in surgery videos is an essential process
  to describe surgeries, which can be used for surgery navigation and evaluation systems.
  In this paper, we argue that an imbalance problem is crucial when we train deep
  neural networks for recognizing surgical instruments using the training data collected
  from surgery videos since surgical instruments are not uniformly shown in a video.
  To address the problem, we use a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based approach
  to supplement insufficient training data. Using this approach, we could make training
  data have the balanced number of images for each class. However, conventional GANs
  such as CycleGAN and DiscoGAN, have a potential problem to be degraded in generating
  surgery images, and they are not effective to increase the accuracy of the surgical
  instrument recognition under our experimental settings. For this reason, we propose
  a novel GAN framework referred to as DavinciGAN, and we demonstrate that our method
  outperforms conventional GANs on the surgical instrument recognition task with generated
  training samples to complement the unbalanced distribution of human-labeled data.

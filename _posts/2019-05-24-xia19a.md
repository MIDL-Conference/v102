title: Adversarial Pseudo Healthy Synthesis Needs Pathology Factorization
abstract: 'Pseudo healthy synthesis, i.e. the creation of a subject-specific ‘healthy’
  image from a pathological one, could be helpful in tasks such as anomaly detection,
  understanding changes induced by pathology and disease or even as data augmentation.
  We treat this task as a factor decomposition problem:  we aim to separate what appears
  to be healthy and where disease is (as a map). The two factors are then recombined
  (by a network) to reconstruct the input disease image. We train our models in an
  adversarial way using either paired or unpaired settings, where we pair disease
  images and maps (as segmentation masks) when available. We quantitatively evaluate
  the quality of pseudo healthy images. We show in a series of experiments, performed
  in ISLES and BraTS datasets, that our method is better than conditional GAN and
  CycleGAN, highlighting challenges in using adversarial methods in the image translation
  task of pseudo healthy image generation.'

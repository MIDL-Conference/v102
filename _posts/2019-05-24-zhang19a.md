title: 'SPDA: Superpixel-based Data Augmentation for Biomedical Image Segmentation'
abstract: Supervised training a deep neural network aims to “teach” the network to
  mimic human visual perception that is represented by image-and-label pairs in the
  training data. Superpixelized (SP) images are visually perceivable to humans, but
  a conventionally trained deep learning model often performs poorly when working
  on SP images. To better mimic human visual perception, we think it is desirable
  for the deep learning model to be able to perceive not only raw images but also
  SP images. In this paper, we propose a new superpixel-based data augmentation (SPDA)
  method for training deep learning models for biomedical image segmentation. Our
  method applies a superpixel generation scheme to all the original training images
  to generate superpixelized images. The SP images thus obtained are then jointly
  used with the original training images to train a deep learning model. Our experiments
  of SPDA on four biomedical image datasets show that SPDA is effective and can consistently
  improve the performance of state-of-the-art fully convolutional networks for biomedical
  image segmentation in 2D and 3D images. Additional studies also demonstrate that
  SPDA can practically reduce the generalization gap.

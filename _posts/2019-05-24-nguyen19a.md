title: A novel segmentation framework for uveal melanoma in magnetic resonance imaging
  based on class activation maps
abstract: 'An automatic and accurate eye tumor segmentation from Magnetic Resonance
  images (MRI) could have a great clinical contribution for the purpose of diagnosis
  and treatment planning of intra-ocular cancer. For instance, the characterization
  of uveal melanoma (UM) tumors would allow the integration of 3D information for
  the radiotherapy and would also support further radiomics studies. In this work,
  we tackle two major challenges of UM segmentation: 1) the high heterogeneity of
  tumor characterization in respect to location, size and appearance and, 2) the difficulty
  in obtaining ground-truth delineations of medical experts for training. We propose
  a thorough segmentation pipeline consisting of a combination of two Convolutional
  Neural Networks (CNN). First, we consider the class activation maps (CAM) output
  from a Resnet classification model and the combination of Dense Conditional Random
  Field (CRF) with a prior information of sclera and lens from an Active Shape Model
  (ASM) to automatically extract the tumor location for all MRIs. Then, these immediate
  results will be inputted into a 2D-Unet CNN whereby using four encoder and decoder
  layers to produce the tumor segmentation. A clinical data set of 1.5T T1-w and T2-w
  images of 28 healthy eyes and 24 UM patients is used for validation. We show experimentally
  in two different MRI sequences that our weakly 2D-Unet approach outperforms previous
  state-of-the-art methods for tumor segmentation and that it achieves equivalent
  accuracy as when manual labels are used for training. These results are promising
  for further large-scale analysis and for introducing 3D ocular tumor information
  in the therapy planning.'

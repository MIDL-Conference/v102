title: Deep Hierarchical Multi-label Classification of Chest X-ray Images
abstract: Chest X-rays (CXRs) are a crucial and extraordinarily common diagnostic
  tool, leading to heavy research for Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) solutions. However,
  both high classification accuracy and meaningful model predictions that respect
  and incorporate clinical taxonomies are crucial for CAD usability. To this end,
  we present a deep Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification (HMLC) approach for CXR
  CAD. Different than other hierarchical systems, we show that first training the
  network to model conditional probability directly and then refining it with unconditional
  probabilities is key in boosting performance. In addition, we also formulate a numerically
  stable cross-entropy loss function for unconditional probabilities that provides
  concrete performance improvements. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first
  to apply HMLC to medical imaging CAD. We extensively evaluate our approach on detecting
  14 abnormality labels from the PLCO dataset, which comprises 198,000 manually annotated
  CXRs. We report a mean Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.887, the highest yet reported
  for this dataset. These performance improvements, combined with the inherent usefulness
  of taxonomic predictions, indicate that our approach represents a useful step forward
  for CXR CAD.

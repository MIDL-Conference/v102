title: Joint Learning of Brain Lesion and Anatomy Segmentation from Heterogeneous
  Datasets
abstract: Brain lesion and anatomy segmentation in magnetic resonance images are fundamental
  tasks in neuroimaging research and clinical practice. Given enough training data,
  convolutional neuronal networks (CNN) proved to outperform all existent techniques
  in both tasks independently. However, to date, little work has been done regarding
  simultaneous learning of brain lesion and anatomy segmentation from disjoint datasets.
  In this work we focus on training a single CNN model to predict brain tissue and
  lesion segmentations using heterogeneous datasets labeled independently, according
  to only one of these tasks (a common scenario when using publicly available datasets).
  We show that label contradiction issues can arise in this case, and propose a novel
  \textit{adaptive cross entropy} (ACE) loss function that makes such training possible.
  We provide quantitative evaluation in two different scenarios, benchmarking the
  proposed method in comparison with a multi-network approach. Our experiments suggest
  ACE loss enables training of single models when standard cross entropy and Dice
  loss functions tend to fail. Moreover, we show that it is possible to achieve competitive
  results when comparing with multiple networks trained for independent tasks.

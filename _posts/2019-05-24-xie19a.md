title: 'VOCA: Cell Nuclei Detection In Histopathology Images By Vector Oriented Confidence
  Accumulation'
abstract: " Cell nuclei detection is the basis for many tasks in Computational Pathology
  ranging from cancer diagnosis to survival analysis. It is a challenging task due
  to the significant inter/intra-class variation of cellular morphology. The problem
  is aggravated by the need for additional accurate localization of the nuclei for
  downstream applications. Most of the existing methods regress the probability of
  each pixel being a nuclei centroid, while relying on post-processing to implicitly
  infer the rough location of nuclei centers. To solve this problem we propose a novel
  multi-task learning framework called vector oriented confidence accumulation (VOCA)
  based on deep convolutional encoder-decoder. The model learns a confidence score,
  localization vector and weight of contribution for each pixel. The three tasks are
  trained concurrently and the confidence of pixels are accumulated according to the
  localization vectors in detection stage to generate a sparse map that describes
  accurate and precise cell locations. A detailed comparison to the state-of-the-art
  based on a publicly available colorectal cancer dataset showed superior detection
  performance and significantly higher localization accuracy."

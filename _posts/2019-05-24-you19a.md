title: Unsupervised Lesion Detection via Image Restoration with a Normative Prior
abstract: While human experts excel in and rely on identifying an abnormal structure
  when assessing a medical scan, without necessarily specifying the type, current
  unsupervised abnormality detection methods are far from being practical. Recently
  proposed deep-learning (DL) based methods were initial attempts at showing the capabilities
  of this approach. In this work, we propose an outlier detection method combining
  image restoration with unsupervised learning based on DL. A normal anatomy prior
  is learned by training a Gaussian Mixture Variational Auto-Encoder (GMVAE) on images
  from healthy individuals. This prior is then used in a Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP)
  restoration model to detect outliers. Abnormal lesions, not represented in the prior,
  are removed from the images during restoration to satisfy the prior and the difference
  between original and restored images form the detection of the method. We evaluated
  the proposed method on Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) of patients with brain tumors
  and compared against previous baselines. Experimental results indicate that the
  method is capable of detecting lesions in the brain and achieves improvement over
  the current state of the art.

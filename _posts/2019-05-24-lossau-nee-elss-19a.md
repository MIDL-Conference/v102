title: Dynamic Pacemaker Artifact Removal (DyPAR) from CT Data using CNNs
abstract: Metal objects in the human heart like implanted pacemakers frequently occur
  in elderly patients. Due to cardiac motion, they are not static during the CT acquisition
  and lead to heavy artifacts in reconstructed CT image volumes. Furthermore, cardiac
  motion precludes the application of standard metal artifact reduction methods which
  assume that the object does not move. We propose a deep-learning-based approach
  for dynamic pacemaker artifact removal which deals with metal shadow segmentation
  directly in the projection domain. The data required for supervised learning is
  generated by introducing synthetic pacemaker leads into 14 clinical data sets without
  pacemakers. CNNs achieve a Dice coefficient of $0.913$ on test data with synthetic
  metal leads. Application of the trained CNNs on eight data sets with real pacemakers
  and subsequent inpainting of the post-processed segmentation masks leads to significantly
  reduced metal artifacts in the reconstructed CT image volumes.
